# blogging
A working web project for your next blog site. Clone this repository and run to have your own blogging website with authorization and authentication. 

So all you gotta do is change the user access in credentials.json file and you are good to go with your blog with just you as admin and others as user. 

Steps for running this application : 

1. Clone the repository
2. Open command prompt
3. move to the directory blogging/server
4. type "node server" and hit enter
5. browse localhost:4000

NOTE : You must have node and npm installed and added to path on your system

I have here integrated an online editor also which just the admin can access to add or edit blogs. 

The editor comes with image support, drag and drop support as well as all possible styles of text you can think of. 

This is just the alpha version and changes would keep rolling in to imporve and add functionalities.

No database as of now has been incorporated to make it portable.
But you can easily swap authentication code snipped in server.js file under server folder, with the one using database. I have already made some sample code and commented it out for mongo DB...
