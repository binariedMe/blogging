# blogging
A working web project for your next blog site. Clone this repository and run to have your own blogging website with authorization and authentication. 

So all you gotta do is change the user access in credentials.json file and you are good to go with your blog with just you as admin and others as user. 

I have here integrated an online editor also which just the admin can access to add or edit blogs. 

The editor comes with image support, drag and drop support as well as all possible styles of text you can think of. 

This is just the alpha version and changes would keep coming to imporve and add functionalities.
